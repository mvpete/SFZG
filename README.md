<h1>MVPete's SUPER FUN ZOMBIE GAME</h1>
<p>This is my first cut at a C++ game engine in SFML. There is a make file in the project that will simply build and link against SFML. You'll need to have the libs built and installed. <br/>
I stopped development on this game for over a year because I ran into a bug with SFML text causing it to crash. It looks like I broke the fading text and that no longer works. I'll be attempting to get this game up and running properly over the next little while. </p>
